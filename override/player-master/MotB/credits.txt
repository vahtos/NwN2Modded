Enhanced Dream Weapon by Kaldor Silverwand
[version!]
https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/prefab/placeable/enhanced-dream-weapon
The longsword version is corrected, so that it no longer prevents future shape changes.The ability of the weapon to change is dependent on the feats of the wielder, rather than the main PC. The weapon now has a form for each weapon type.

Golem Fighting Bugfix by Vandervecken
v.160820
http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/prefab/item/golem-fighting-bugfix-red-wizard-academy-motb
At the Academy of Shapers and Binders in Act II of Mask of the Betrayer, you can participate in a Golem fighting ring. You can construct you Golem out of a number of different Golem pieces you have acquired during your travels. Part of the purpose of this minigame is to construct and disassemble your Golem until you hit upon winning combinations against the various combinations your golem faces. Unfortunately, if you install the Galvanized Golem Torso or the Weather-resistant Golem Torso, disassembling your Golem will return you only a generic Golem Torso. Those advanced torso pieces are gone for good. You don't even get their benefits on the golem.
The cause of this is some mis-set variables on the objects themselves.

Open Gawatha's Door by kevL
v.171019
In Coveya Kurg'annis, if Kepob is ransomed, Gawatha's party exits through the north door. But the door is closed and they won't open it themselves. This fix inserts 'ga_door_open_gawatha' on the dialog-node that forces Gawatha's party to exit.

Anya Sleep fix by kevL
v.171019
In Janiik's Farmhouse, Anya doesn't want to sleep sometimes. The fix is to use GetNearestObjectByTag() instead of GetObjectByTag() since it seems more robust at getting the Anya-object. Also (cosmetic) Anya tries to face the fireplace when she sleeps.

Dialog Fixes by JOG
v.180913
MotB: Ice-Troll-Lodge Bugfix AND MotB: Lurure Bears Bugfix. This fixes the bug where you can't join the Ice Troll Lodge when you already won the Test of Prowess a second time. This fixes a bug in with Okku's tribe at the Wells of Lurure: When you devoured Okku, were female and had Gann in your party the conversation would simply end after Gann had his line without the bears becoming hostile. [kevL lifted these 2 - http://mods.jo-ge.net/nwn2/index.htm - after a recommend by NinjaSpectre]

Fentomy dialog fix
v.190623
Fentomy on the Lakeshore could potentially ramp up companion influences infinitely. This fix checks for a local_int on Fentomy "Revealed" and, if found, disallows each of the four dialog-nodes that lead to revealing Fentomy's disguise, hence should stop infinite influence gains. (And potentially infinite losses on some of the other subnodes, it seems.) Spotted by rsw0x.
