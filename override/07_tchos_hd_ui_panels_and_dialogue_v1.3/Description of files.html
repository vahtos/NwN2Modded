<body><h3>Container</h3><p>Panel lengthened to show more items in containers, and uses a larger, mixed-case font.</p><h3>container_recipe</h3><p>This is the recipe system for Storm of Zehir, made bigger.</p><h3>Charchoice</h3><p>Menu buttons for choosing existing characters or new characters, made bigger.</p><h3>internetbrowser</h3><p>The multiplayer Gamespy screen.</p><h3>playerlogin</h3><p>The Bioware account login box for multiplayer play.</p><h3>Fontfamily and Stylesheet</h3><p>These
files make all the fonts larger.&nbsp; If you don't like them this
size, you can delete these files or adjust the font sizes yourself to
taste. &nbsp;It can be edited with any text editor.</p><h3>Journal</h3><p>This makes the journal/quest log <em>much</em>
larger.&nbsp; Mostly in height, but in width as well.&nbsp; Less
scrolling through your little quest log to find that one quest!</p><h3>LoadGameScreen</h3><p>These
 three files are the menus for loading one of your saved games. &nbsp;The 
list containing your saved games is now larger, in a mixed-case font.</p><h3>CharacterScreen and CreatureExamine</h3><p>These
 files apply the NWN1-style portrait aspect ratio to the "Character" 
panel that appears when you press "C" for yourself or your companions.&nbsp; 
The 3D portraits remain square, and are not distorted, but there is 
empty space at the top and bottom of the portrait area.&nbsp; This is where 
you select an alternate portrait, by double-clicking on the square 
portrait.</p><h3>InventoryScreen</h3><p>This is unchanged from 
Fire&amp;Ice's Big Fonts.&nbsp; It combines the separate bags into one big 
bag, displays some useful character stats below the paperdoll for use in
 checking how changes of gear affect the stats, and includes a cargo 
button for Storm of Zehir (does nothing outside of SoZ).&nbsp; If you don't 
like one big bag, delete this file.&nbsp; At some point, I'd like to increase
 the size of the inventory icons.</p><h3>Quickchat</h3><p>This is the 
main dialogue/conversation panel.&nbsp; It's bigger, uses a larger font, and 
has a pleasant colour scheme, though I didn't realise at the time that 
some dialogue in the game and in modules would use colour tags that 
assume a dark background, thus making them difficult to read.&nbsp; I'll 
provide another version of this file with the original colour scheme at a
 later date.</p><p>This does not affect the Storm of Zehir party chat, 
which is a separate file.</p><h3>partychat</h3><p>This
is the Storm of Zehir party chat. &nbsp;I've increased the size of
the&nbsp;panel (and made a new background image to allow it), moved the
portrait down from the header into the text area and adjusted the NPC
speaking area to compensate, increased the size of the speaker's name
in the header, and adjusted all of the portraits to the NWN1 aspect
ratio.</p><h3>Store</h3><p>This is the panel you see when 
you're buying or selling at a vendor.&nbsp; Bigger, mixed-case font, larger 
height.&nbsp; Less need for scrolling at stores with a lot of inventory!</p><h3>PartyBar</h3><p>This
 lengthens the height of the party bar on the right side of the screen 
to use the full height of a 1920x1080 screen.&nbsp; If you have more than 
will fit on that screen, a scroll bar will appear.&nbsp; It also uses the 
NWN1-style portrait aspect ratio.</p><h3>nx2_ol_partybar</h3><p>The party bar that shows on the overland map in Storm of Zehir, in the NWN1-style portrait aspect ratio.</p><h3>Portrait_change</h3><p>This
 is the panel you'll see when you double-click the portrait in the 
character screen to select a new one.&nbsp; It's much larger, and uses the 
NWN1-style portrait aspect ratio.&nbsp; To add more portraits to this list, 
any TGA file will work, but it should be in a multiple of 256x400, and 
it should be placed in your Documents\Neverwinter Nights 2\portraits 
folder.&nbsp; If there is no portraits folder there, you should create one.&nbsp; 
Smaller pictures will be scaled up, and larger ones will be scaled 
down.&nbsp; I've provided some portraits for the purpose.</p><h3>spells_memorized</h3><p>This
 file is used to display all of the spells that the selected character 
currently has memorised.&nbsp; The font is now bigger, and the panel is 
longer, to show more spells without scrolling.&nbsp; I&nbsp;haven't reached the 
maximum level yet, so I&nbsp;don't know if this panel would benefit from more
 height, if you can't get spells at a high enough level to fill the 
space.&nbsp; I&nbsp;had it 100 pixels taller than this at first.</p><h3>spells_known</h3><p>This
 file is used to display all of the spells that the selected character 
currently knows.&nbsp; The font is now bigger, and  the panel is longer, to 
show more spells without scrolling.&nbsp; I&nbsp;also widened it, so that it could
 show some of the longer spell names (especially the ones that used 
metamagic feats) without going to two lines.&nbsp; I remade an extended top 
graphic for the new width, but I&nbsp;couldn't get it to display past the 
original width, for some reason, so I&nbsp;just removed the empty boxes that 
made the non-extended stretching look bad.&nbsp; This is an acceptable 
compromise.</p><h3>quickspell</h3><p>This
panel appears when you press "F", and shows all spells currently
castable.&nbsp; It now shows more spells than before, with its
increased height, and will only ever need scrolling if you have many
levels of spells and many metamagic feats.</p><h3>optionscreen</h3><p>The game options screen optimised for larger fonts.</p><h3>noticewindow</h3><p>Changed the all-caps yellow notices that pop up at the top of the screen (for instance, for journal updates) to mixed case.</p><h3>nx2_market and nx2_storage</h3><p>The trading system panels for Storm of Zehir, made bigger.</p><h3>examine</h3><p>A larger panel and bigger font on the description panel when you examine an object or character.</p><h3>target_object and target_enemy</h3><p>This
 is the little panel on the top of the screen that shows a little 
picture of whatever you target, and how many HP&nbsp;it has, if applicable.&nbsp; 
I've expanded its height to acommodate the NWN1 aspect ratio portraits.</p><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>The
 following files are changed to larger fonts, but the panels aren't 
expanded as much as they could be.&nbsp; They're included here for the sake 
of completeness.</p><h3>chargen_abilities and levelup_abilities</h3><p>Your ability scores/attributes.</p><h3>chargen_bfeats and levelup_bfeats</h3><p>Bonus feats.</p><h3>chargen_nfeats and levelup_nfeats</h3><p>Normal feats.</p><h3>chargen_skills and levelup_skills</h3><p>Your list of starting skills.</p><h3>chargen_spells and levelup_spells</h3><p>Where you pick your spells on level up.</p><h3>gui_bhvr_update.ncs</h3><p>This
 file simply renames one of the stealth behaviour options to a shorter 
name to fit in the available space with its bigger font.</p></body></html>
