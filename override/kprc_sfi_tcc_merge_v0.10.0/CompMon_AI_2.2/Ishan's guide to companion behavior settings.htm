<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>BAB-High
and Melee focused characters:</span></b><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'><br>
– Follow at Near distance<br>
– Using Ranged Weapons and Auto-Switching to Melee at Far distance<br>
– Spellcasting Mode: Scaled to Overkill, depending on rest-possibilities and
expected encounter difficulty<br>
<br>
<b>BAB-Medium characters:</b><br>
– Follow at Medium distance<br>
– It can be more comfortable to have a trap-finding/auto-disabling rogue follow
at Near distance<br>
– Using Ranged Weapons and Auto-Switching to Melee at Medium distance<br>
– Spellcasting Mode: Scaled to Overkill, depending on rest-possibilities and
expected encounter difficulty<br>
<br>
<b>BAB-Low or Ranged Weapon focused characters:</b><br>
– Follow at Far distance<br>
– Using Ranged Weapons and Auto-Switching to Melee at Near distance<br>
– Back-away if you think this (temporary) party member is too vulnerable and/or
can’t equip/use a ranged weapon/spell and/or is totally useless in melee combat
and/or always in your way<br>
– Spellcasting Mode: Scaled to Overkill, depending on rest-possibilities and
expected encounter difficulty<br>
<br>
With the suggested settings, your melee party members shouldn’t constantly run
into Area-of-Effect spells (AoE), traps, and other dangerous situations. They
will early switch from ranged to melee mode and move to the front to hold up
the charging melee-enemies.<br>
It’s never a wrong idea to constantly control any of the melee characters (or a
rogue if traps are expected) of the party outside of combat, because party
leaders will usually draw the first attacks and therefore should have many
hitpoints and/or high evasive abilities. If you still insist on controlling
only your spellcaster/ranged weapon PC then don’t forget to withdraw behind the
melee party members when combat starts.<br>
If you encounter enemy spellcasters with nasty AoE spells, rather move manually
all party members close to the spellcaster. Your party will be much safer and
probably dish out a lot of Attacks of Opportunities then.<br>
<br>
Use the All-button to easily switch from Scaled to Overkill at Spellcasting for
all party members depending on rest-possibilities and expected encounter
difficulty.<br>
<br>
To prevent abuse of precious potions and other items, keep the items to your
player-controlled character and/or put them into magic bags, and distribute
them only to your AI-controlled companions when necessary.<br>
<br>
<b>Animal Companions/Familiars/NPCs:</b> Don’t forget to set their behavoir
also when they are summoned or temporarily join the party! Since AI-mod v0.18,
the AI-behavoir settings are saved if associates die and/or are re-summoned.
You can access their character sheet by RMB on the creature or portrait by the <b>Examine</b>
option<br>
<b>Defend Master:</b> It’s always advantageous if more party members
concentrate on a single foe. It is especially useful at characters with sneak
attack.<br>
<b>Stealth Mode:</b> More comfortable is to use the specific
&quot;Stealth&quot; broadcast/voice command. The party leader has to sneak also
to make companions stay in sneak mode.<br>
<b>Dispel Spells:</b> I’d rather cast manually dispel magicks instead of
automatically have precious buffs being constantly removed. If you don’t care,
turn it on.<br>
<b>(Healing) Item Usage:</b> Always on, and don’t forget to set at least Scaled
at Spellcasting Mode, otherwise no (healing) items will be used!<br>
<b>Ability Using/Combat Modes:</b> Always on. The Ability Usage frequency is
also tied to the Spellcasting Mode setting!<br>
<b>Polymorph:</b> I’m not a big fan of this because it often ruins the
atmosphere of auto-triggered dialogue sequences after combat. I’d polymorph only
manually if it’s really necessary at all.<br>
<b>Summons:</b> Can’t hurt to have some extra help or targets for the enemy.
Animal Companions and familiars won’t be summoned this way.<br>
<b>Infinite Buffs:</b> I’d rather choose manually the single bard inspiration
but turn on at warlocks.<br>
<b>Back away:</b> You can turn this on for vulnerable spellcasters or pure
ranged-attackers but don’t expect any fancy evasive actions.<br>
<b>Other Party-Options:</b> Decide for yourself.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Monster Stealth</b>: Always turn this on for atmosphere’s and enemy rogues’
sake. The AI creatures should automatically leave stealth mode if they are
attacked.<br>
<b>Monsters Wander</b>: This makes many creatures randomly walk once in a while
if they don’t have a scripted move/hold order. However, I recommend switching
this off in areas where you expect dialogues (e.g. urban areas) as nothing
sucks more than being more or less trapped in a dialogue while wandering
monsters attack your party.<br>
It can accidentally happen that wandering, enemy NPCs attack other neutral NPCs
if they get too close. This usually happens if module builders haven’t set the
faction settings correctly or did that by purpose for any reasons.<br>
<b>Monsters Open/Bash/Unlock Doors</b>: These settings gives wandering
creatures the possibility to open/bash/unlock doors. I always turn this off
because you never know what module-specific script trouble you can cause by
having creatures leave their designated area/room positions and bash/unlock
doors which should not be opened yet. Whatever you set here, it’s possible that
enemy creatures will still open and possibly bash/unlock doors if they have
detected the party and/or possibly other faction foes on the other side, or
were attacked at least once!<br>
<b>Knockdown:</b> Sometimes (or even off) is always better than always on!<br>
There is an alternative how to restrict the general usage of Knockdown if you
dare to modify a game file:<br>
1. Extract the <b>feat.2da</b> file out of the <b>Program
Files\NWN2\Data\2DA.zip</b> archive.<br>
2. Copy this file into the <b>My Docs\NWN2\Override</b> folder.<br>
3. Use <i>TlkEdit</i> found <a
href="http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Other.Detail&amp;id=669"
target="_blank"><span style='color:windowtext'>here</span></a> to edit the <b>feat.2da</b>
file. (Run <i>TlkEdit2.exe</i> for NWN2!)<br>
4. Look for the (Improved) Knockdown rows 17 &amp; 23 and change at column <b>UsesPerDay</b>
the <b>****</b> entry to <b>-1</b><br>
5. In the same rows, change at column <b>Cooldown</b> the <b>****</b> entry to <b>18</b>
seconds or any other timer value you like<br>
6. Save the file with <i>TlkEdit</i> and you are good to go with less knockin’!<br>
7. You could also repeat this for <i>(Improved) Disarm</i> at row 9 &amp; 16 or
possibly for other active feats you wish</span></p>
