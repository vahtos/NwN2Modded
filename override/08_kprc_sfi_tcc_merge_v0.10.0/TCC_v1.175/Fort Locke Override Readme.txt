If you have already been to Fort Locke, returning there with these three area files in the override folder
will cause the area's encounters and triggers to reset.

This causes several oddities:

1) Galen will be back at the begining area agruing with his guards again.
2) The soldiers that were harrassing Neeshka will have respawned.
3) Approaching the soldiers will re-trigger Neeshka's first conversation and the sodliers will stay friendly.
4) Tor Millows (the priest) will likely not talk to you. He might if you haven't done his quest yet though.
5) Cormick will have reappeared. He'll leave after you talk to him.
6) If you're in Act II, leaving the area will only give you access to Act I locations.
   Simply go to a location present in both Acts (the Market District for instance) to restore the map to normal.

After saving Galen and viewing his inventory, and leaving the area, it would probably be best to delete the
three files from your override folder.

The Azim Store file override should not cause any issues, and should be fine to leave alone.
