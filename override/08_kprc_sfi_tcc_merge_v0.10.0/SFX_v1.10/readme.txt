===========================================

This is a simple merge of Kaedrin's PrC pack (v1.36.1) version of the spell 'Cone of Cold' and the light emitter I created for the same spell.

To use - after having installed both my Light Emitters in Spell Effect pack and Kaedrin's PrC pack, first delete nw_s0_conecold.ncs and .nss files that came with my pack. This should be located in the root of your ..\My Documents\Neverwinter Nights 2\override folder. After those two files are deleted, unzip the two files included in this zip file, and place them in the cmi_spells folder associated with Kaedrin's PrC pack - most likely the path will look like ..\My Documents\Neverwinter Nights 2\override\cmi_spells. Be sure to overwrite the existing files in this folder. If you want to keep the original files from either pack, just rename the file extensions to something that NWN2 does not recognize (.old is a good choice). Kaedrin's version of the spell 'Cone of Cold' should now work with my Light Emitters VFX without any conflicts.
