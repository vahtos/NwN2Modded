<color=Gold><b>Half-Celestial</b></color>

A celestial's magical nature allows it to breed with virtually any creature. The offspring of the resulting unions, half-celestials, are glorious and wonderful beings. To carry out their resposibilities, celestials sometimes spend great amounts of time in the mortal realms. being devoted and kind, they occasionally fall in love with mortals: humans, elves, unicorns, and similar creatures. The objects of celestials are never evil and are always intelligent. they always return the love of their immortal paramour and willingly conceive the child, usually caring for it since the celestial has other duties.

No matter the form, half-celestials are always comely and delightful to the senses, having golden skin, sparkling eyes, angelic wings, or some other sign of their higher nature. though noble and compassionate, half-celestials are often dismayed at the evil amoung their kin and take a stern, sometimes harsh, view of base instincts or malevolent actions. Never truly fitting into any mortal society, half-celestials are usually loners and wanderers attempting to right wrongs wherever they can.
