As of 6-11-10:

The Reeron.2da file is used to:

1) Control the rate at which summons scale with you in the Animate Dead, ELemental Summoning pool, Create Undead, Create Greater Undead, and Summon Creature scripts. 

2) Control the rate at which summons' AC scales with you in all the summoning scripts that I have modified (and actually use AC-scaling).




If you are not using my Improved folder you can still keep this 2da file as it doesn't affect anything else.








If you want the summons' level to scale with you at 1/2 your level, then leave the two variables (Undead_level_variable_a and Undead_level_variable_b) at their default values of 1 and 2. If you want them to scale with you at 4/5 your level, then set variable a to 4 and variable b to 5. You can set the variables however you want, but don't use a zero for the 2nd variable as that will cause a divide by zero error. If you don't want the level to scale at all then set variable a to zero and variable b to any number except zero (can leave it at it's default vale of 2).



If you want the summons' AC to scale with you at 1/2 your level, then leave the two variables (Shield_AC_variable_a and Shield_AC_variable_b) at their default values of 1 and 2. If you want them to scale with you at 4/5 your level, then set variable a to 4 and variable b to 5. You can set the variables however you want, but don't use a zero for the 2nd variable as that will cause a divide by zero error. If you don't want the AC to scale at all then set variable a to zero and variable b to any number except zero (can leave it at it's default vale of 2).


In the future, all of the variables in my summoning scripts will be able to be altered through the use of this 2da file.



PS- Thanks to Xing (over on the NWN2 forum boards) and Flagcarrier for "motivating" me to do this, as well as giving me the idea.
