Final Battle door lock fix by kevL's
v.160904
The script locks the door but doesn't make sure it's shut first. This shuts the door and locks it.

Lizardfolk Warrior fix by kevL's
v.180214
This lizard should not drop its Claw and Bite creature-weapons. The fix here gives its blueprint Creature Weapon Proficiency.

Goodie (diary) fix by kevL's
v.180228
One of the goodies that appear randomly on the OverlandMap is a diary. Unfortunately the placeable is flagged static and it doesn't have an OnUsed script. So, while it appears on the OL like any other goodie, the PC can't activate it to get a reward. This fix removes the static-flag, enables the usable-flag, and assigns it the standard OnUsed script for goodies.

More Lizardfolk fixes by kevL's
v.180303
Lizardmen shouldn't drop their claws. This gives them Creature Weapon Proficiency so they'll equip their claws and keep them equipped instead. Same with the umberhulk thrall creature.

Teamwork Training fixes by kevL's
v.180406
The script (m_c_tw_rush) that checks prerequisites for Team Rush should require that the pc-speaker has *both* the Toughness feat AND Survival skill 8+. The script (m_c_tw_cob) that checks prerequisites for Circle of Blades should require that the pc-speaker has *both* BAB 6+ AND Weapon Specialization (any melee). The script (m_c_tw_foe) that checks prerequisites for Foe Hunting should require that other party-members have *both* BAB 4+ AND Survival skill 1+; also allow Favored Enemy Plant to satisfy pc-speaker prerequisite. The script (m_c_teamwork) that checks if Circle of Blades has already been trained also mistakenly checked that Superior Flank had not been trained yet (note: this script may clash with an alternate method using global_ints that also get used to check if a particular Teamwork feat has been trained - usage seems arbitrary). Daerred's dialog (m11_daerred) was missing several navigation nodes (these were fixed by someone else and I only include the file here). Candril's dialog (m11_candril) referenced a non-existent script (m_c_trance_prereq) and is properly 'm_c_tw_trance' (this was fixed by someone else and I only include the file here).

Trip fix by kevL's
v.180406
Worgs and Mastiffs (tag-based creature-weapon scripts) were disallowing knockdown on higher difficulty levels. The fix is to invert the operation and disallow knockdown on lower difficulties.

Trade UI backout fix by kevL's
v.180408
In the UIScene of these XML files, closing them by pressing the Escape key would try to fire a script 'ga_enc_ignore' but it doesn't exist. The proper script to fire is 'gui_enc_ignore' when these Trade UI screens close. That is, nearby encounters on the OL Map should ignore the PC when a Trade UI screen is open, and then stop ignoring the PC when the screen is closed.

Neverwinter City Guard dialog fix by kevL's
v.180417
Fixed typo "bPassPurcahsed" to "bPassPurchased". Also added a couple of end-dialog nodes (so that even if you have the coin there's an option to back out of the dialog).

Strange Druid dialog fix by kevL's

The Strange Druid fight would not start if he was intimidated. Fixed by adding ga_initiate_encounter() to the Attack node. Reported by Question2.

logistical fixes for nx2_crafting.2da by kevL
v.181008
Nx2_Crafting.2da has numerous formatting errors. This fix corrects those but does not attempt to address any gameplay mechanics.

Fix prototype vs definition default value mismatch in GetCaravanIncome() by kevL
v.181122
The default value for 'nLevel' in the prototype was 1 while that in the definition is 0. This fix sets them both to 0 (rather arbitrarily - I mean it might be better as "1" but you'd have to poke through SoZ for a couple hours to figure that out with any degree of certainty).

- Campaign
kinc_trade.NSS


Nevalle dialog fix by Travus (impl. kevL)
v.181122
Nevalle asks for 800 tradebars for the trading post in Neverwinter but didn't take them. This fix takes them.

SoZ: Accusation in Nimbre and the Inquisitive Pig by HS_Tri
v.190214
An attempt at restoring the Nimbre situation in Obsidian's expansion Storm of Zehir. Now you can convince the captain to let the villagers go if you find evidence that there is a traitor living in their village. Additionally this restores the Inquisitive Pig. Spoilers: Spot 8 will let you notice the loremaster's snake tattoo. He then proceeds to attack you. Two cultists will join the battle (not terribly difficult). On the loremaster's body you will find a certain scroll which you can show to the captain outside. The villagers won't be terribly thankful, though... As far as the pig is concerned, just speak to it.

Port Llast Undead Army Fix (SoZ)
v.190216
This is a simple fix for (some) of the problems with the Port Llast quests that have to do with Septimund, Nya, and Lord Adreum. I [Joshauwa] have only fixed errors where it is obvious what the developers have meant to do, so I have not assumed that the developers meant to allow you to lead the undead army into Port Llast AND keep Septimund, since there is no evidence in the scripting that this was an original plan. Also, while it is feasible that there was supposed to be an option to put Adreum to rest without leading the army or killing him, I found no evidence for it and so did not create it. It also seems reasonable that the developers originally meant Adreum to only show up when Nya mentioned him, but there's also no real evidence in the scripting for that, so I didn't change it. Finally, I didn't bother fixing the sloppy coding that doesn't actually affect gameplay: the music doesn't change back in the graveyard after the undead army leaves, for example. If anyone feels inclined to changed these things, they are welcome to use the files in my fix as a starting point (you shouldn't need any other files, except that you will have to create scripts and journal entries that don't yet exist).

Sheydann dialog (swamp cult) fix by kevL
v.200305
If the PC is male with less than 10 Diplomacy the dialog has no where to go. Fix: link the dangling node to the same nodes that would appear if the PC were female.

Skullcrusher dialog fix by kevL
v.200310
"Huh. Well, you look like know how to handle yourself ..."
- remove check for all players >= level 5 to prevent dangling node in multiplayer
"Well said. I'm sure there's something out there that could knock you down ..."
- remove check for all players >= level 10 to prevent dangling node in multiplayer
"Like you?"
- fix arguments for gc_skill_rank so it checks for Diplomacy >= 4 instead of CraftArmor >= 6
