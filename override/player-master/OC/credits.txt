[version!]
https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/script/nwn2-oc-nasher-set-fix
Makes the Nasher item set available, it was not available ingame (and the unique ring appeared in two places). Adds cloak and gloves to OC and gives a set bonus.

Logram and Yaisog fix by kevL
v.160904
In module 1300_Old_Owl_Well, area 1319_eyegougerl2, Logram can't equip his arms and armor because he doesn't have the necessary proficiences and the items are not identified. Yaisog needs his arms and armor identified before he can equip them. This fix brings both NPCs to combat readiness.

Temple of Seasons fix by kevL
v.160907
The final dialog can be borked if an uncontrolled companion crosses its trigger. This fix changes the OnEnter script of the trigger, and ensures that only a controlled character can start the Purification Ritual. A second change is for the door to the final statue room, raising its DC from 18 to 99 so it's no longer an egregious exploit.

Black Garius + nightwalker fix by kevL
v.161003
At the defense of Crossroad Keep, when Black Garius is about to summon his nightwalker, he gets distracted and often doesn't complete his dialog successfully due to all the fighting going on in the courtyard. If the nightwalker does not summon, the plot breaks because it needs to be defeated for the plot to continue. This fix temporarily removes several of Black Garius' AI scripts related to combat, so that he does not react to being hit by arrows and so is no longer tempted to retaliate against the greycloaks that surround the barricade. This allows his dialog to complete and the nightwalker to be summoned correctly. His AI then returns to normal and the Battle of Crossroad Keep commences.

Deekin Keep Dialog fix by kevL
v.170207
Allows Deekin to upgrade his store (twice), allows any/all of his various greetings to show, and increases what he's willing to pay for items (instead of decreasing). WARNING: I arbitrarily decreased the increase from 10% to 5% on his initial store, then on Upgrade 1 it resets to 0% (stock), and on Upgrade 2 it jumps to its full 10% MarkUp/MarkDown (always in favor of the player).

Get Soldiers Dead fix by kevL
v.171117
In Module 2000_Neverwinter, dialog '20_deorwin', Deorwin gives one response if he's the only soldier left alive and a different one if he's not. Bug: The script that checks this condition returns FALSE only if no soldiers died (which is redundant since Doerwin is a soldier and the PC is talking to him); so, the condition is always TRUE, causing Doeorwin to state that he has to bury "four sons" - instead of falling through to the next dialog-node, in which he gives the PC thanks for bringing "us" through. This fix modifies the script to check that all other four soldiers have died in the battle with Qaggoth, while protecting Cyran, and indeed Deorwin is the only soldier left alive.

Battle of the Rod fix by NinjaSpectre and kevL
v.180426
In Module 3000_Neverwinter_A3, strange things can happen (including perhaps breaking the game if the Rod of Never is dropped) after the PC exits the Underneath and the reaver assassination attempt is made on Lord Nasher in the throne room. This attempts to smooth things through what is essentially a very long cutscene.

Hlam dialog fixes by NinjaSpectre
v.180426
When telling Khelgar to be a monk, the order on the check was wrong so you could never succeed (although not really a big problem since that is what he chooses if you let him decide). The next one is when you leave the conversation before making the final choice. The entry back into this decision didn't check if Khelgar was with you or if he had already made the choice. I moved this into the same area as the check for each of the trials, and put condition checks on it to make sure all 3 have been completed before being available. The last thing I did is set the flag for Khelgar being a monk even though you tell him to stay a warrior. This is because the Journal states that the quest is finished and I didn't notice any other variable being set for this outcome. [kL_note: That might make for some weirdness if subsequent scripts/dialogs think Khelgar actually is monk.] Without this change Khelgar could still become a monk afterwards trough the dialog, but the Journal would not be updated from before.

Niyra Mithral Chainmail Drop fix by kevL
v.180913
Niyra has a suit of Elven Chainmail in her inventory that will drop but it does not have the Mithral armorrulestat (it's not regular Elven Chainmail either) although its material-type is Mithral. This fix replaces that item with one that has the Mithral armorrulestat.

Nevalle dialog fix by kevL
v.180920
Nevalle could assign the PC to the Disturbing Connections quest at any time, but the dialog itself refers to the PC as a Squire. This fix ensures that the PC is a Squire in good standing with Neverwinter, cleared of all allegations, before the quest will be assigned. Reported by zzc.

Hlam dialog fix + Another Hlam dialog fix by sanpats
v.180921
Modified the fix by NinjaSpectre, but change nkhelgarismonk=1 to nkhelgardecided=1 when he decided to stay as a fighter, to ensure compatibility with later dialogs that may think Khelgar is a monk when he stay as a fighter. In case that Khelgar decided to be a monk, I set both nkhelgarismonk and nkhelgardecide to 1. All condition checks in this dialog that check nkhelgarismonk was changed to check nkhelgardecided instead.

11_wounded_wyl.DLG - set "11_bWylState" = 1 correctly so that Ward's dialog will know you've found Wyl (as is done in '11_wounded_ward.DLG')

Georg and Tarmas fix by kevL
v.190416
Fixes stuff in the opening battle in West Harbor after the tutorial finishes.
11_a_georg_lv.NSS - better redundancy check that ensures Georg gets to the gathering point before the wheatfield battle; refactored and optimized because it's just too difficult/frustrating to figure out what's going on otherwise.
11_cs_tarmas.NSS - move Tarmas to a gather-point instead of directly to the wheatfield; do not assign Tarmas a custom heartbeat script (ForceRest) since it just gets in the way of his actions/combat/behaviors.
11_dcr_tarmaswheat.NSS - get the nearest hostile creature to a friendly who is below half health for Tarmas to target. ie, Rewrite script.
11_wound_heal.NSS - don't AssignCommand to OBJECT_SELF; check the entire PC party for moss, not just the true PCs; don't make recruits wait so long before moving to destination; refactored and optimized overall.
1100_client_en.NSS - destroy pre-placed Tarmas and spawn Tarmas w/ spells; this instantiates the 'tarmasbattle.UTC' file.
tarmasbattle.UTC - this is not a copy of the stock 'tarmasbattle.UTC' but a copy of the pre-placed Tarmas as he appears in West Harbor. It is identical to the pre-placed Tarmas except it has Ray of Frost (x4), Magic Missile (x4), Melf's Acid Arrow (x4), Flame Arrow (x3), and uses the standard heartbeat script instead of the ForceRest script.

Many Starred Cloaks fix (Vale, Sevann, Nathe) by kevL
v.200118
flag Vale,Sevann,Nathe as immortal and Vale as plot for the Crossroad Keep basement battle with BlackGarius. The problem is that if Vale dies the game breaks since his dialog is required to exit the basement. When the PC first meets the MSC they are spawned from blueprints that have the flags set properly; but a change was made to preplace them in the basement before the battle, but those flags were not set. This fix changes the flags of the preplaced instances to match those of the blueprints, in the OnEnter script of the Crossroad Keep basement. (Note: I left Vale as non-plot but immortal, since there is code in the AI that can prevent plot-characters from becoming engaged in combat.)

Alteration Powder fix by kevL
v.200203

Lyssa bluffed fix by kevL

Consolidate 2330_cli_enter.NSS by kevL
v.200220
The OnClientEnter (area) script '2330_cli_enter' exists in two versions: one for 2300_Crossroad_Keep_Adv (module) and another for 2000_Neverwinter (module). They are different but the same filename is slotted for specific areas' OnClientEnter events of both modules. This creates a conflict when a script of that filename is in the Override folder; the engine is going to use the script in Override regardless of which area is entered. So this tweak merges the two stock scripts of both areas together into one script, separated into two distinct codeblocks that are conditioned according to whether or not Torio is present. Both are the basement areas of Crossroad Keep - 2330_ck_base (area in 2300_Crossroad_Keep_Adv) is used for the Torio cutscene after the Trial By Combat, and 2330_ck_base (area in 2000_Neverwinter) is used for the battle against Black Garius with the Many Starred Cloaks. The merged script shall be kept in the 2300_Crossroad_Keep_Adv folder, however, since that's where the prefix of its filename implies it should be.
