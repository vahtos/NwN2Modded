 menus and loading screens for NWN2 were designed for a 4:3 monitor 
aspect ratio, and on a modern widescreen display will appear either 
stretched out vertically or have black bars on the sides.<br><br>Additionally,
 when you patch your game to the latest version, the vanilla menus are 
changed to a Storm of Zehir theme, which, while well-designed, is a 
little too specific for my taste -- and was especially inappropriate 
when I hadn't yet played the OC or Mask of the Betrayer!<br><br>This 
interface mod provides a menu and loading screen background based upon 
the original vanilla version, but edited to full HD widescreen format.&nbsp; 
I&nbsp;made them in such a way as to have as little distortion as possible, 
and none in the focal area.&nbsp; They should scale down to lower widescreen 
resolutions as well.<br><br>Also available here is a background to add a
 little more life to the character creation and level-up screen and 
other screens that use the same background.&nbsp; Install this by placing it 
in the same location as the others.&nbsp; You can replace this with any 
wallpaper of your choice if you save your chosen wallpaper as a TGA with
 the same name as this one.&nbsp; It will need to be in a 16:9 aspect ratio 
or it'll be distorted.<br><br><b>2. Requirements</b><br>Neverwinter Nights with both expansions.<br><br>This
 mod overrides certain graphics from Expansion 2:&nbsp;Storm of Zehir, and 
I've only tested it with Neverwinter Nights Platinum, which includes 
both expansions.&nbsp; It <i>may</i> also work on the vanilla game with the latest patch.<br><br><b>3. Installation</b><br>The
 mod is provided in a compressed folder.&nbsp; You can move this folder into 
your override folder, or if you prefer to keep your override folder 
empty, it should also work if you move the folder into your UI\custom\ 
folder.<br><br>Both override and UI folders are usually found in 
Documents\Neverwinter Nights 2\override and Documents\Neverwinter Nights
 2\ui respectively.&nbsp; See <a _fcksavedurl="http://nwn2.wikia.com/wiki/Installation_directories" href="http://nwn2.wikia.com/wiki/Installation_directories">this wiki page</a> for more information on installation directories.<br><br><b>4. Using the mod</b><br>You should know if it's working or not as soon as the main menu screen appears.<br><br><b>5. Known Issues</b><br>None currently known.<br><br><b>6. Use in other mods</b><br>You are welcome to improve upon my work.<br><br><b>7. Revision history</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2012-03-09: Initial release<br><br><b>8. Credits</b><br>This
 was a solo effort, but I'm always indebted to the modders/builders who 
have contributed to the accumulated body of knowledge on the web, to 
allow me to know where to start in the first place.<br><br>Image for optional background from official Neverwinter wallpaper.<br><br><b>9.
