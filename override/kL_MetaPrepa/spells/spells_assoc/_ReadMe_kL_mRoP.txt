The files in this directory change Animal Companions & Familiars slightly. They contain a fix, a workaround, and some hopefully only minor modifications. See the scripts for more detail.

The #include file 'mrop_cmi_animcom' handles companions from Cyphre's Animal Pack and has a workaround for not having Kaedrin's PrC Pack installed. It is needed to recompile the Animal Companion & Familiar scripts.

This directory can be deleted without affecting other functionality of the MetaRod add-on. Its primary purpose is to add spellhooks to the Feats so that the MRoP can prepare them.
