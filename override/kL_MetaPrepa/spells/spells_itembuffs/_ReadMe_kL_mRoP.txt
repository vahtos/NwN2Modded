The files in this folder are altered spellscripts for NwN2. They have been altered to conform to Kaedrin's PrC Pack v.1.41.4 (or added from there), K2's Light Emitters, and my (kevL's) metaRod of Preparations, aka Rod of Metamagics. The original Rod of Preparation is by LostCreations and is available here:

The purpose of having these nonstandard files here is to allow the Rod of Metamagics to cast armor, shield, and weapon enhancing buffs directly onto an item in a party member's inventory or weapons/armor slots. Usually, for a caster to buff another character's non-primary weapon or shield, the item would have to be transferred to the caster for that purpose; the same has to be done when the metaRod is in Learn mode, but once that is done and the metaRod is placed into Play mode then the item can be left on any character in the party and the spell-buff preparation ought reach it. I got really bored with having to transfer off-hand weapons and shields back & forth ....

I'm not sure how well these scripts work without Kaedrin's PrC Pack installed (or what version). If you want to delete them due to poor performance (ie. if items are not getting the proper enhancements), go ahead: the only drawback should be the loss of functionality described above. AND DON'T CAST BUFFS DIRECTLY ON ITEMS!!! The spells themselves will fall back on the standard NwN2 scripts (or whatever other replacements are in your override, etc.). If you want to merge them with your own corresponding scripts, I've tried to demarcate the necessary code, for the metaRoP, to make this as easy as possible.


play well!

oh, ps. The scripts were compiled with Kaedrin's set on UseFullCasterLevels - 3 ( the -3 is my own modification, so if you want to recompile them with your own options using Kaedrin's standard #includes there it is ).
