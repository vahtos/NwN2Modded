Added custom feat entry 418. 

418: This feat allows a Divine Champion to use the Lay on Hands ability to damage Undead (2989). This feat is tied into the 
regular Lay on Hands feat (299), so using either feat automatically decreases the number of uses left of the 
other feat.

419 Added so Weapon Focus Falchion can be properly taken when leveling as a Divine Champion.

420 Added so Improved Critical Warmace can be properly taken when leveling as a Divine Champion.
