Skeleton Cloth Armor Tint Fix by rjshae
[version!]
http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/images/texture/skeleton-cloth-armor-tint-fix
The file name was assigned to the tint map slot of the skeleton model but is missing from the final release of the game. As a result, the unpatched skeleton model does not tint properly and it shows the missing tint map error texture on the model.

OC Doors Fix by crystal violet
[version!]
http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/hakpak/original-hakpak/oc-doors-repair-override
These are replacements for some of the original door models and one normalmap. I've tried to repair some minor texturing errors, odd shading issues and logical errors (doors that have a window on one side but not on the other).

Imbue Item Indexing Bug Fix by Lord Grave
v.150122
https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/script/imbue-item-indexing-bug-fix
This is most commonly known as "Power Essence Bug" when using Warlock's Imbue Item feat to add basic enchantments to weapons and armor with Power Essences in MotB crafting system. Although you put correct item and correct essences in the satchel, when you use Imbue Item on it you get a message saying that it is not a valid recipe.
NWN2 has a recipe index used to make searching for valid recipes faster and it is located in crafting_index.2da file. Function GetRowIndexes() is used to fetch a short list of valid recipes for the spell the player cast on the crafting container. MotB developers used this function to fool the containers into thinking that Imbue Item feat is the correct spell. Basically, their piece of code for Imbue Item feat fetches all recipes that require spells by checking if category column contains a numerical string with StringToInt() function, which will return 0 if you try to convert a non-numerical string into an integer. However, they forgot that this function will also return 0 for a '0' string, and there is a group of recipes, starting at ID 40, that requires the spell ID 0 (Acid Fog). The function will simply return a list of recipes starting form the beginning and ending just before the recipes that require Acid Fog spell, leaving slightly more than half of the list unusable for a Warlock. Instead of rewriting their code, I just altered it slightly so that it skips row 40 from the index file when checking whether StringToInt of the category row returns 0.
NOTE: These scripts were implemented/compiled by kevL: I added a few scripts that can be traced back to the changed function, although this might not be strictly required.
NOTE: Lord Grave also fixed a mismatched prototype/definition for GetIsItemPropertyAnUpgrade() in 'ginc_crafting'.

Greatclub description fix by Lance Botelle (implemented by kevL)
v.160912
Greatclubs were set to use a description that has 1d6 piercing damage and small weapon size. The actual statistics are 1d10 bludgeoning damage and large weapon size. So the baseitems.2da column "BaseItemStatRef" has been changed to reflect something similar. The new description, however, says the Greatclub needs proficiency with Martial weapons while the actual reference is to either Martial or Rogue, and the Critical threat says 19-20 while the actual reference is 20 (stock values were Martial and Rogue, and 19-20). To achieve maximal conformity, the Dialog.Tlk file would need to be changed also (and that's beyond the purview of this partial fix).

GUI improvement by kevL
v.161008
The area for an intro-message in the default UI's stringinputmessagebox.xml has so little vertical height that only one line is displayed at a time and the up/down scroll-buttons almost completely overlap, making them difficult to use. This improvement adds 50 pixels to the height for the intro-message.

Preference AI fix, by kevL
v.171118
In 'gai_preference_dcr', type ATTACK_PREFERENCE_TANK, an NPC-tank may try to heal itself by calling TalentHealingSelf() from 'x0_i0_talent'. The return was checked against a value of 99, but the function will return 0 or 1 only. The condition has been changed to check against TRUE, to properly bypass regular DCR when the NPC-tank performs a heal action on itself.

Werewolf/Wererat weapon orientation fix by ArtEChoke
v.190604
This is a simple orientation fix for the attachment points on the Obsidian Werewolf skeleton. This fix applies to the Ossian Wererat, as it shares the same skeleton. Previously the werewolf held weapons at a bizarre angle that clipped with its body and arms. This new skeleton will point the weapons in the proper direction. What this fix does *NOT* do is add proper weapon grasping animations, or proper weapon wielding animations. The creature will still attack with one left claw swipe (or whatever weapon you put in its left hand) and one bite.

Staff of Balpheron fix by Clangeddin
v.191226
The problem is the OnEquip tag-based item script, that script applies a bunch of properties whenever it fires, the OnUnequip related script removes those properties. Here's the problem though, when you load the game, the OnEquip script fires, but the OnUnequip one does not, so if you equip, save, load, save, load, save, load, save, etc you will keep on stacking those properties until you get a staff with more than 255 item properties, which causes the engine to not load the character properly when the game is loaded; in fact, all other items are not displayed either in the inventory. What I did with the fix was simply add a local var check that would not apply the properties again if the item was already equipped, then I added the delete local var to the OnUnequip script to make sure it works properly later.

Changes to spell scripts involving 100% immunity by Clangeddin
v.200103
The following spells had their 100% damage immunity changed to 9999 damage resistance, this is done to prevent the damage immunity overflow bug that turns them into vulnerabilities once they go past 100%. This operates under the same principle of the energy immunity spells (level 6 cleric, druid, bard spell and level 7 for Wiz/Sorc). The affected spells are:
1. Shadow Shield
2. Death Ward
3. Mass Death Ward
4. Iron Body (electric immunity only)
5. Stone Body (same as above)

MotB rest problems fix (reverts some of Nwn2Fixes OverlandMap ApplyDialogSkillEffect() fix)
v.200331
The underlying bug is that, in SoZ on the overlandmap, the player can choose a dialog option to Intimidate an encounter before going into battle but EffectShaken() and EffectOffGuard() use negative values when constructing the effects. Positive values should be used in 'ginc_overland' instead (the constructors for the effects will subtract the positive values).

Tracing those functions back through several layers, they could be called by 'gui_rest'. HOWEVER the only place i *know* of them being used is on the SoZ OL. And those are handled by just two scripts: 'ga_initiate_encounter' and 'ga_mated_encounter'.

So basically i'm going to delete 'gui_rest.NSS/.NCS' and 'k_mod_player_rest.NSS/.NCS' and 'ginc_restsys.NSS'. But keep 'ginc_overland' because it has the core fix, as well as 'ga_initiate_encounter' and 'ga_mated_encounter' because they (definitely) use it. Note that 'x2_inc_restsys' fixes a prototype/definition mismatch for WMSetAreaTable() so it should stay (unless it's still an issue).

Additionally, it's nice to get the module-level script 'k_mod_player_rest' out of the Fixes package.
