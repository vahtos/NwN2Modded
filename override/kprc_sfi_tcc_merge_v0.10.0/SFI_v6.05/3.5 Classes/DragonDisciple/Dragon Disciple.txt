        Thank you Piotyr! 
        Also known as Chaos-Piotyr on the NWN2 forum boards. Without his help you wouldn't be reading this. 
        He's the one who motivated me to attempt this.



        PnP Dragon Disciple (actually the same as Obsidian defaults):

        Requires Bard/Sorcerer, Lore 8 ranks (no knowledge Arcana available).



	Gains the following* :

	1st level: 1st Bonus Spell-slot.
	2nd level: 2nd Bonus Spell-slot. Also, gains Bite/Claws attacks based on size. Medium-sized 
                   gains 1d6Bite/1d4Claws. Small-sized gains 1d4Bite/1d3Claws.

	3rd level: Nothing extra.
	4th level: 3rd Bonus Spell-slot.
	5th level: 4th Bonus Spell-slot.
	6th level: 5th Bonus Spell-slot.
	7th level: Nothing extra.
	8th level: 6th Bonus Spell-slot.
	9th level: 7th Bonus Spell-slot.
	10th level: Nothing extra.


        *De-leveling will remove any bonuses granted as if you never had the class level.



        NOTE: You must use my equip and un-equip scripts. All of the Bonus Spell-slots are controlled 
              through the use of these scripts. Without them this class will not work properly. Also, 
              to properly use this hak, you must remove all of your RDD levels (then you can add them 
              back in once my hak is in your override folder) so that all my custom feats (grants Bonus Spell-slots) 
              will be added at level-up.
