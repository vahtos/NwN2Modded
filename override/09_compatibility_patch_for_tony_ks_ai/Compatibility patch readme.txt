These three files will make Tchos' HD UI panels and dialogue compatible with Tony_K's Companion and Monster AI 2.2.  The files affect the two versions of the Character Sheet, which is accessed by pressing "C" by default.  Specifically, they now include Tony_K's additions to the Behaviour tab.  The revised Stylesheet.xml is required, because it widens the behaviour columns and changes the all-caps font to mixed-case so that all options are visible in their entirety.

Check your override and UI\custom folders and subfolders for other copies of these files, delete or rename them, and replace them with these.
