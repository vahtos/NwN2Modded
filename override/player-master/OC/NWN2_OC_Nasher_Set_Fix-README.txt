NWN2 OC Nasher Set Fix v20091224

by Brendan Bellina, aka "Kaldor Silverwand"

What this is:

Lord Nasher has four magical items - boots, gloves, cloak, and ring. But in the NWN2 OC you can only get the ring and boots. According to the descriptions these four items when worn together provide additional enhancements, though individually they are outmatched by other items in the OC. These four items were defined in the game toolset but only the boots and ring were placed into the game itself. The ring, although intended to be a unique item, is actually in the OC in two places.

The included scripts when copied into yur override folder will address three problems:
- the ring will no longer be available twice
- the cloak and gloves will now be available
- when all four items are worn together they will be enhanced


Compatibility:

These scripts should be compatible with the OC, MoTB, and SoZ. MoTB and SoZ are not required.

These items were created for the OC Makeover SoZ Edition and are included in v20091224 and later of the Makeover, although they can also be used independently of it.


Installation Instructions:

Copy the NWN2_OC_Nasher_Set_Fix_scripts folder and its contents to your NWN2 Override folder.


About the items:

Nasher's Nimble Boots (x2_nash_boot): The boots are found at Highcliff. They provide a +3 Dexterity adjustment. When worn with the full set of four items the boots are enhanced to a +7 Dexterity adjustment, a Dodge AC bonus of +5, and Freedom of Movement.

Nasher's Cloak of Protection (x2_nash_cloak): The cloak is now found in the dragon hoard in Act III. It provides a +3 Deflection AC bonus. When worn with the full set of four items the cloak is enhanced to a +7 Deflection AC bonus, +5 Universal Saving Throw adjustment, and +3 Charisma adjustment. In the unmodified OC the cloak is not available.

Nasher's Gloves of Combat (x2_nash_glove): The gloves are given by Kana in response to a very successful handling of a Hobgblin problem at the Keep. The gloves provide a +5 Parry Skill adjustment. When worn with the full set of items the gloves are enhanced to +10 Parry, 1d8 Bludgeoning damage, Attack Bonus of +5, and Daze on Hit (save 20). In the unmodified OC the ring is given as the reward rather than the gloves. Because the gloves are given as a reward you will get them only if the reward is earned.

Nasher's Ring of Strength (x2_nash_ring): The ring can be purchased from Nya in Port Llast. It provides a +3 Strength adjustment. When worn with the full set of four items the ring is enhanced to a +7 Strength adjustment and a Spell Resistance of 10. In the unmodified OC the ring is for sale by Nya in Port Llast and is also given by Kana as a reward for killing the Hobgoblins.
