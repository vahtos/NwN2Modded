Don't be a dick. If you use these, make sure you don't take credit for yourself. 
If anyone tries to give you the credit, do the right thing and make sure to point out WHO ACTUALLY DID THE WORK. 
People taking credit for my hard work is why I left the community, and why (before I left) I started hiding my work by not releasing 
the source code.
