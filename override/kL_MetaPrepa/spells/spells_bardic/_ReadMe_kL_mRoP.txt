The files in this directory are the 7 Bard Inspirations. These are feats that can be added as preparations to the Book of Preparations, but to do this in a consistent fashion I had to add a line of code in each that enables Spellhooking to work with the spellscripts.

Other than that, the scripts were tidied but no functional changes have been done.

Please note that multiple Inspirations can be prepared as Pages of Preparation in the Book and, if left there, this gives rise to rather arbitrary behavior during the casting routine. Only one should be in a Book at any time. The reason that multiple preparations are permitted is so that the player can quickly swap out a prepared Inspiration for a different one, without having to enter Learning mode - just make sure that only one is in the Book at any given time, and keep the rest ( if you have more than one Page of Inspiration ...) elsewhere in your regular inventory.
